            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                As an aspiring Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer, I am dedicated to building modern, 
                functional, and accessible web solutions. I specialize in front-end technologies such as HTML, 
                CSS, and JavaScript, alongside UI/UX design tools like Figma. My goal is to combine technical
                skills with design thinking to create seamless digital experiences, while continuing to develop 
                professionally in both development and design.
